# Market Microstructure

Market microstructure studies how orders become trades. Understanding this is essential for building strategies that actually work in live markets.

<ConceptCard title="The Order Book" type="definition">
The **order book** is the list of all pending buy and sell orders for an asset. It shows supply and demand at each price level and determines where trades occur.
</ConceptCard>

## Bids and Asks

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="Spread = Ask - Bid"
  explanation="The bid-ask spread is the cost of immediately entering and exiting a position."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "Ask", meaning: "Lowest price sellers will accept" },
    { symbol: "Bid", meaning: "Highest price buyers will pay" },
    { symbol: "Spread", meaning: "Transaction cost for market orders" }
  ]}
/>

<InteractiveExample title="Live Order Book" description="See how buy and sell orders stack up at different price levels">
  <OrderBook
    data={{
      bids: [
        { price: 99.50, size: 1500 },
        { price: 99.45, size: 2200 },
        { price: 99.40, size: 3100 },
        { price: 99.35, size: 1800 },
        { price: 99.30, size: 4500 },
        { price: 99.25, size: 2800 },
        { price: 99.20, size: 3500 }
      ],
      asks: [
        { price: 99.55, size: 1200 },
        { price: 99.60, size: 1900 },
        { price: 99.65, size: 2500 },
        { price: 99.70, size: 3200 },
        { price: 99.75, size: 2100 },
        { price: 99.80, size: 4000 },
        { price: 99.85, size: 2700 }
      ]
    }}

## Price Impact

<ConceptCard title="Market Impact" type="warning">
Large orders move prices. If you try to buy 10,000 shares but only 1,000 are offered at the best ask, you'll "walk up the book" and pay higher prices. This **slippage** can destroy strategy profitability.
</ConceptCard>

## Order Types

<ConceptCard title="Market vs Limit Orders" type="example">
**Market Order**: Execute immediately at best available price. You're a "taker" who pays the spread.

**Limit Order**: Wait in the book until someone trades with you. You're a "maker" who earns the spread (or part of it).
</ConceptCard>

## Liquidity

<ConceptCard title="Liquidity" type="definition">
**Liquidity** measures how easily you can trade without moving the price. High liquidity means tight spreads and deep order books. Low liquidity means wide spreads and high impact costs.
</ConceptCard>

<KeyTakeaway>
Market microstructure determines your **real execution costs**. A strategy that looks profitable in backtests can fail live due to spread costs and market impact. Always account for realistic transaction costs when evaluating strategies.
</KeyTakeaway>
