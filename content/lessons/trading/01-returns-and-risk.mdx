# Returns & Risk Measurement

Understanding how to measure returns and risk is fundamental to quantitative trading. This lesson connects the math foundations to real trading applications.

<ConceptCard title="Risk-Adjusted Returns" type="definition">
Raw returns don't tell the whole story. A 20% return with 5% volatility is very different from 20% return with 40% volatility. **Risk-adjusted metrics** help us compare strategies fairly.
</ConceptCard>

## The Sharpe Ratio

The most common risk-adjusted return metric:

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="SR = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}"
  explanation="The Sharpe Ratio measures excess return per unit of risk."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "SR", meaning: "Sharpe Ratio" },
    { symbol: "R_p", meaning: "Portfolio return" },
    { symbol: "R_f", meaning: "Risk-free rate" },
    { symbol: "\\sigma_p", meaning: "Portfolio standard deviation" }
  ]}
/>

## Maximum Drawdown

<ConceptCard title="Drawdown" type="warning">
**Maximum Drawdown (MDD)** measures the largest peak-to-trough decline. A strategy with 50% MDD means you could lose half your capital before recovering. Most traders can't psychologically handle more than 20-30% drawdown.
</ConceptCard>

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="MDD = \frac{Trough - Peak}{Peak}"
  explanation="Drawdown measures the decline from the highest point to the lowest point."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "MDD", meaning: "Maximum Drawdown" },
    { symbol: "Peak", meaning: "Highest portfolio value" },
    { symbol: "Trough", meaning: "Lowest value after the peak" }
  ]}
/>

      { date: "2023-01", equity: 100000, drawdown: 0 },

      { date: "2023-03", equity: 115000, drawdown: 0 },
      { date: "2023-04", equity: 105000, drawdown: -8.7 },
      { date: "2023-05", equity: 98000, drawdown: -14.8 },
      { date: "2023-06", equity: 112000, drawdown: -2.6 },
      { date: "2023-07", equity: 120000, drawdown: 0 },
      { date: "2023-08", equity: 118000, drawdown: -1.7 },
      { date: "2023-09", equity: 125000, drawdown: 0 },
      { date: "2023-10", equity: 130000, drawdown: 0 }

## Sortino Ratio

<ConceptCard title="Downside Risk" type="tip">
The **Sortino Ratio** only penalizes downside volatility, not upside. This makes more sense because investors don't mind upside "risk"!
</ConceptCard>

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="Sortino = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_d}"
  explanation="Like Sharpe, but uses downside deviation instead of total standard deviation."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "\\sigma_d", meaning: "Downside deviation (volatility of negative returns only)" }
  ]}
/>

<KeyTakeaway>
Always evaluate strategies using **risk-adjusted metrics** like Sharpe and Sortino ratios. A strategy with lower absolute returns but better risk-adjusted returns is often preferable. Maximum drawdown tells you the worst-case scenario you need to survive.
</KeyTakeaway>
