# Live Execution Case Study

The gap between backtest and live trading is where most strategies die. This lesson covers the realities of running a strategy with real money.

<ConceptCard title="The Live Trading Gap" type="warning">
**Why live results differ from backtests:**
- Slippage: You don't get the price you expected
- Latency: By the time you trade, the signal is stale
- Partial fills: You wanted 1000 shares, got 500
- Market impact: Your own orders move the price
- Operational errors: Bugs, network issues, fat fingers
</ConceptCard>

## Execution Quality

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="Slippage = Execution\;Price - Decision\;Price"
  explanation="The cost of not getting the price you wanted."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "Execution\\;Price", meaning: "Actual fill price" },
    { symbol: "Decision\\;Price", meaning: "Price when signal fired" }
  ]}
/>

<InteractiveExample title="Execution Quality Analysis" description="Tracking slippage over time">
  <Histogram
    data={[
      { bin: "-0.10%", count: 5 },
      { bin: "-0.05%", count: 15 },
      { bin: "0.00%", count: 25 },
      { bin: "+0.05%", count: 30 },
      { bin: "+0.10%", count: 18 },
      { bin: "+0.15%", count: 7 }

## Position Management

<ConceptCard title="Live Position Tracking" type="definition">
**Reconciliation** ensures your system's view of positions matches the broker's. Discrepancies can occur from:
- Partial fills
- Rejected orders
- Corporate actions
- System crashes

Run reconciliation at least daily, ideally real-time.

      { date: "Mon 09:30", equity: 100000, drawdown: 0 },
      { date: "Mon 12:00", equity: 100500, drawdown: 0 },
      { date: "Mon 16:00", equity: 100300, drawdown: -0.2 },

## Risk Controls

<ConceptCard title="Kill Switches" type="tip">
**Essential safeguards:**
- **Max position size**: Never exceed X% in one asset
- **Max daily loss**: Stop trading if down Y% today
- **Order size limits**: No single order > Z shares
- **Fat finger protection**: Reject orders outside price bands
- **Heartbeat monitoring**: Alert if system stops responding
</ConceptCard>

## The First Month Live

<ConceptCard title="Ramping Up" type="example">
**Week 1**: Paper trade (no real money)
- Verify signals match backtest
- Test order routing
- Monitor execution quality

**Week 2-3**: Tiny size (1-5% of target)
- Real money, minimal risk
- Compare live vs backtest
- Debug issues

**Week 4+**: Gradual increase to target size
- Scale up only if results match expectations
- Never rush to full size
</ConceptCard>

<InteractiveExample title="Position Sizing Ramp-Up" description="Gradual scaling to full position">
  <LineChart
    data={[
      { x: 1, y: 0, y2: 100 },
      { x: 2, y: 5, y2: 100 },
      { x: 3, y: 10, y2: 100 },
      { x: 4, y: 25, y2: 100 },
      { x: 5, y: 50, y2: 100 },
      { x: 6, y: 75, y2: 100 },
      { x: 7, y: 100, y2: 100 }
    ]}
    xLabel="Week"
    yLabel="Position Size (% of Target)"
    title="Conservative Ramp-Up Schedule"
    series={[
      { key: "y", name: "Actual Size", color: "#3b82f6" },
      { key: "y2", name: "Target", color: "#d1d5db" }
    ]}
  />

## Learning from Live Trading

<ConceptCard title="Post-Trade Analysis" type="definition">
**After every trade:**
1. Compare execution to backtest assumption
2. Calculate slippage and market impact
3. Log any operational issues
4. Update slippage model for future backtests

Live trading is the ultimate feedback loop. Use it to improve your models.
</ConceptCard>

<KeyTakeaway>
Live trading is harder than backtesting. Budget for **slippage**, implement **risk controls**, and **ramp up slowly**. The first month should focus on validating your system works, not making money. Treat every live discrepancy as a learning opportunity.
</KeyTakeaway>
