# Scientific Method in Trading

Quantitative trading is applied science. We form hypotheses, test them against data, and let evidence guide our decisions.

<ConceptCard title="The Scientific Approach" type="definition">
A **trading hypothesis** is a testable claim about market behavior. "Stocks that go up tend to keep going up" is a hypothesis (momentum). We test it with data, not gut feelings.
</ConceptCard>

## Hypothesis Formation

<ConceptCard title="Good vs Bad Hypotheses" type="example">
**Good**: "Stocks with earnings surprises > 5% outperform by 2% over the next month"
- Specific, measurable, falsifiable

**Bad**: "The market will go up because it feels oversold"
- Vague, subjective, not testable
</ConceptCard>

## The Research Pipeline

<InteractiveExample title="From Idea to Strategy" description="The systematic process of strategy development">
  <LineChart
    data={[
      { x: 1, y: 100, y2: 100 },
      { x: 2, y: 60, y2: 95 },
      { x: 3, y: 30, y2: 85 },
      { x: 4, y: 15, y2: 70 },
      { x: 5, y: 8, y2: 50 },
      { x: 6, y: 3, y2: 25 }
    ]}
    xLabel="Research Stage"
    yLabel="Ideas Remaining (%)"
    title="Strategy Funnel: Most Ideas Fail Testing"
    series={[
      { key: "y", name: "Ideas Remaining", color: "#3b82f6" },
      { key: "y2", name: "Cumulative Effort", color: "#f59e0b" }
    ]}
  />
</InteractiveExample>

<ConceptCard title="Research Stages" type="tip">
1. **Hypothesis** - Form testable idea
2. **Initial Test** - Quick backtest on subset of data
3. **Refinement** - Adjust parameters, add filters
4. **Out-of-Sample** - Test on held-out data
5. **Paper Trading** - Test in live market (no money)
6. **Live Trading** - Real capital, small size first
</ConceptCard>

## Avoiding Data Snooping

<ConceptCard title="Data Snooping Bias" type="warning">
If you test 100 strategies, 5 will look great by pure chance (at 5% significance). This is **multiple hypothesis testing bias**. The more you look, the more "patterns" you'll find that aren't real.
</ConceptCard>

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="P(false\;positive) = 1 - (1 - \alpha)^n"
  explanation="The probability of at least one false positive increases with the number of tests."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "\\alpha", meaning: "Significance level (e.g., 0.05)" },
    { symbol: "n", meaning: "Number of hypotheses tested" }
  ]}
/>

<InteractiveExample title="Multiple Testing Problem" description="Probability of finding fake patterns by chance">
  <ScatterPlot
    data={[
      { x: 1, y: 5 },
      { x: 5, y: 23 },
      { x: 10, y: 40 },
      { x: 20, y: 64 },
      { x: 50, y: 92 },
      { x: 100, y: 99 }
    ]}
    xLabel="Number of Strategies Tested"
    yLabel="Probability of False Positive (%)"
    title="False Discovery Rate vs Number of Tests"
  />
</InteractiveExample>

<KeyTakeaway>
Treat trading like science: form **testable hypotheses**, use **out-of-sample data** for validation, and account for **multiple testing bias**. Be skeptical of results that seem too good - they usually are.
