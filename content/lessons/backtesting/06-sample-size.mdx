# Sample Size Requirements

How much data do you need to trust your backtest results? More than you think.

<ConceptCard title="Statistical Significance" type="definition">
A backtest result is **statistically significant** if it's unlikely to have occurred by chance. With small samples, even random strategies can look profitable.
</ConceptCard>

## The T-Test for Sharpe

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="t = \frac{SR \times \sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{1 + SR^2/2}}"
  explanation="T-statistic for testing if Sharpe ratio is significantly different from zero."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "t", meaning: "T-statistic (need > 2 for 95% confidence)" },
    { symbol: "SR", meaning: "Observed Sharpe ratio" },
    { symbol: "n", meaning: "Number of observations (years or trades)" }
  ]}
/>

<ConceptCard title="Years Needed" type="warning">
For a Sharpe ratio of 1.0 to be significant at 95% confidence:
- **~4 years** of data minimum
- For Sharpe 0.5: **~16 years** needed!

Most "alpha" disappears with proper statistical testing.

## Number of Trades

<ConceptCard title="Trade Count Matters" type="tip">
Beyond years of data, you need enough trades:
- **< 30 trades**: Results are essentially meaningless
- **30-100 trades**: Rough indication only
- **100-500 trades**: Reasonable confidence
- **500+ trades**: Statistical reliability
</ConceptCard>

  <Histogram

      { bin: "45-47%", count: 5, category: "30 trades" },
      { bin: "47-49%", count: 15, category: "30 trades" },
      { bin: "49-51%", count: 30, category: "30 trades" },
      { bin: "51-53%", count: 25, category: "30 trades" },
      { bin: "53-55%", count: 15, category: "30 trades" },
      { bin: "55-57%", count: 10, category: "30 trades" }

## Practical Minimums

<ConceptCard title="Minimum Requirements" type="example">
Before trusting a backtest:
- **5+ years** of data (preferably 10+)
- **100+ trades** minimum
- Multiple market regimes (bull, bear, sideways)
- Out-of-sample validation

If you can't meet these, treat results as hypotheses, not facts.
</ConceptCard>

<KeyTakeaway>
Small samples lie. You need **years of data** and **hundreds of trades** for statistically meaningful results. A 2-year backtest with 50 trades proves nothing. Always calculate confidence intervals and be honest about uncertainty.
</KeyTakeaway>
