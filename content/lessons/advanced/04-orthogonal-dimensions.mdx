# Orthogonal Dimensions

Finding truly independent alpha sources requires understanding the dimensionality of returns. Most "new" factors are just repackaged versions of existing ones.

<ConceptCard title="Factor Crowding" type="definition">
**Factor crowding** occurs when many strategies load on the same underlying factors. "Value" and "quality" strategies may both be betting on the same dimension. True diversification requires **orthogonal** (independent) return sources.
</ConceptCard>

## Principal Component Analysis

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="Returns = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \beta_i \times PC_i + \epsilon"
  explanation="PCA decomposes returns into independent components."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "PC_i", meaning: "Principal Component i (orthogonal factor)" },
    { symbol: "\\beta_i", meaning: "Loading on component i" },
    { symbol: "\\epsilon", meaning: "Idiosyncratic return (unexplained)" }
  ]}
/>

<ConceptCard title="What PCA Reveals" type="example">
For equity returns:
- **PC1** (~40%): Market factor (beta to S&P)
- **PC2** (~15%): Size factor (small vs large)
- **PC3** (~10%): Value/Growth
- **PC4+**: Sector, momentum, other factors

Most "alpha" is actually exposure to these few dimensions.

## Finding True Alpha

<ConceptCard title="Residual Returns" type="tip">
**True alpha** is what remains after removing exposure to known factors:

1. Regress strategy returns on factor returns
2. The intercept (alpha) is pure skill
3. The residuals are idiosyncratic bets

If alpha disappears after factor adjustment, you were just harvesting risk premia, not generating alpha.

      { x: -2, y: -4, label: "Crisis Month" },
      { x: -1, y: -1.5, label: "" },

      { x: 2.5, y: 5.2, label: "" }

## Constructing Orthogonal Portfolios

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="Portfolio_{orthogonal} = Portfolio - \beta \times Factor"
  explanation="Remove factor exposure to isolate pure alpha."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "\\beta", meaning: "Factor loading" },
    { symbol: "Factor", meaning: "Factor return (market, size, etc.)" }
  ]}
/>

<ConceptCard title="Market Neutral" type="warning">
**Market neutral** strategies have zero beta to the market. But they may still have exposure to other factors (size, value, momentum). True factor-neutral strategies hedge ALL known factors, not just market.
</ConceptCard>

<KeyTakeaway>
Most return variation comes from a few common factors. Use **PCA** to identify the true dimensions of returns. **Factor-adjust** your strategies to measure true alpha. Build **orthogonal portfolios** by hedging out factor exposures for genuine diversification.
