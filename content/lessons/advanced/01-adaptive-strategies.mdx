# Making Strategies Adaptive

Static strategies decay as markets evolve. Adaptive strategies adjust their parameters based on changing market conditions.

<ConceptCard title="Strategy Decay" type="definition">
**Alpha decay** is the gradual loss of strategy profitability over time. As more traders discover a pattern, they compete it away. Adaptive strategies fight decay by continuously evolving.
</ConceptCard>

## Dynamic Parameter Adjustment

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="Param_t = Param_{t-1} + \eta \times \nabla Performance"
  explanation="Adjust parameters in the direction that improves recent performance."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "Param_t", meaning: "Parameter value at time t" },
    { symbol: "\\eta", meaning: "Learning rate (how fast to adapt)" },
    { symbol: "\\nabla Performance", meaning: "Gradient of performance metric" }
  ]}
/>

<ConceptCard title="Adaptation Methods" type="example">
**Rolling optimization**: Re-optimize parameters on recent data window
**Online learning**: Update parameters after each trade
**Regime-conditional**: Use different parameters for different market states
</ConceptCard>

      { x: 2018, y: 100, y2: 100 },
      { x: 2019, y: 115, y2: 112 },
      { x: 2020, y: 125, y2: 118 },

## Volatility Scaling

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="Position = \frac{Target\;Vol}{\sigma_{realized}} \times Base\;Position"
  explanation="Scale position size inversely to current volatility."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "Target\\;Vol", meaning: "Desired portfolio volatility" },
    { symbol: "\\sigma_{realized}", meaning: "Current realized volatility" }
  ]}
/>

<ConceptCard title="Why Scale by Volatility?" type="tip">
Markets alternate between calm and volatile periods. **Volatility targeting** reduces position size when risk is high and increases it when risk is low. This smooths returns and improves Sharpe ratio.
</ConceptCard>

<InteractiveExample title="Volatility-Scaled Returns" description="More consistent returns through position sizing">
  <Histogram
    data={[
      { bin: "-4%", count: 2, category: "Unscaled" },
      { bin: "-3%", count: 5, category: "Unscaled" },
      { bin: "-2%", count: 12, category: "Unscaled" },
      { bin: "-1%", count: 20, category: "Unscaled" },
      { bin: "0%", count: 25, category: "Unscaled" },
      { bin: "1%", count: 18, category: "Unscaled" },
      { bin: "2%", count: 10, category: "Unscaled" },
      { bin: "3%", count: 5, category: "Unscaled" },
      { bin: "4%", count: 3, category: "Unscaled" }
    ]}

<KeyTakeaway>
Adaptive strategies combat alpha decay by adjusting to market changes. Key techniques include **rolling parameter optimization**, **volatility scaling** for consistent risk, and **regime-conditional parameters**. The goal is robust performance across different market environments.
