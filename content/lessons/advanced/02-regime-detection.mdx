# Regime Detection

Markets cycle through different regimes: bull, bear, high volatility, low volatility. Detecting regimes allows strategies to adapt their behavior.

<ConceptCard title="Market Regimes" type="definition">
A **regime** is a persistent market state with distinct statistical properties. Bull markets have positive drift and low volatility. Crisis periods have negative drift and high volatility. Different strategies work in different regimes.
</ConceptCard>

## Hidden Markov Models

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="P(S_t | S_{t-1}, Observations)"
  explanation="HMMs infer hidden states (regimes) from observable data (returns)."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "S_t", meaning: "Hidden state (regime) at time t" },
    { symbol: "S_{t-1}", meaning: "Previous state" },
    { symbol: "Observations", meaning: "Return series" }
  ]}
/>

<ConceptCard title="Two-State HMM" type="example">
**State 1 (Bull)**: μ = +0.05%/day, σ = 0.8%
**State 2 (Bear)**: μ = -0.1%/day, σ = 2.0%

The model learns transition probabilities: P(Bull→Bear), P(Bear→Bull)

## Volatility Regimes

<ConceptCard title="VIX-Based Regimes" type="tip">
Simple but effective:
- **VIX < 15**: Low vol regime (trend strategies work)
- **VIX 15-25**: Normal regime
- **VIX > 25**: High vol regime (mean reversion works)

No fancy model needed - just conditional on observable volatility.

      rowLabels: ["Trend", "Mean Rev", "Carry"],
      columnLabels: ["Low Vol", "Normal", "High Vol"],
      data: [
        [1.8, 1.2, 0.4],
        [0.6, 1.0, 1.5],
        [1.4, 0.9, -0.5]
      ]
    }}

## Regime-Switching Strategies

<ConceptCard title="Implementation" type="warning">
**Challenge**: Regime detection has lag. By the time you detect a bear market, much of the damage is done.

**Solution**: Use probabilistic weights rather than hard switches. If P(bear) = 70%, run 70% defensive, 30% aggressive.
</ConceptCard>

<KeyTakeaway>
Markets move through distinct regimes with different return/risk characteristics. Use **Hidden Markov Models** or simple **volatility thresholds** to detect regimes. Apply **regime-conditional strategies** but account for detection lag by using probabilistic weights.
</KeyTakeaway>
