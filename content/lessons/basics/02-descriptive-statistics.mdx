# Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics help us summarize and understand the characteristics of return distributions.

<ConceptCard title="Why Statistics Matter" type="definition">
Financial returns are random variables. **Descriptive statistics** summarize their behavior with just a few numbers: mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis. These metrics form the foundation of risk management.
</ConceptCard>

## Measures of Central Tendency

### Mean (Expected Return)

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="\bar{R} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i"
  explanation="The arithmetic mean is the simple average of all returns."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "\\bar{R}", meaning: "Mean return" },
    { symbol: "R_i", meaning: "Return in period i" },
    { symbol: "n", meaning: "Number of observations" }
  ]}
/>

<ConceptCard title="Mean vs Median" type="tip">
The **mean** is sensitive to outliers. One huge loss can drag down the average. The **median** (middle value) is more robust. Compare both to understand your data.
</ConceptCard>

## Measures of Dispersion

### Variance and Standard Deviation

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (R_i - \bar{R})^2"
  explanation="Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "\\sigma^2", meaning: "Variance" },
    { symbol: "\\sigma", meaning: "Standard deviation (square root of variance)" }
  ]}
/>

## Higher Moments

### Skewness

<ConceptCard title="Distribution Asymmetry" type="warning">
**Negative skewness** means the left tail is longer - there are more extreme losses than extreme gains. Most financial returns are negatively skewed, meaning crashes are more severe than rallies.
</ConceptCard>

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="Skew = \frac{E[(R - \mu)^3]}{\sigma^3}"
  explanation="Skewness measures asymmetry in the distribution."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "Skew > 0", meaning: "Right tail is longer (positive skew)" },
    { symbol: "Skew < 0", meaning: "Left tail is longer (negative skew)" }
  ]}
/>

### Kurtosis

<ConceptCard title="Fat Tails" type="definition">
**Kurtosis** measures how much probability is in the tails vs the center. High kurtosis ("leptokurtic") means more extreme events than a normal distribution predicts. Financial returns typically have kurtosis > 3, meaning "fat tails."
</ConceptCard>

<InteractiveExample title="Normal vs Fat Tails" description="Actual returns have more extreme events than normal distribution predicts">
  <LineChart
    data={[
      { x: -4, y: 0.5, y2: 2 },
      { x: -3, y: 2, y2: 5 },
      { x: -2, y: 10, y2: 12 },
      { x: -1, y: 25, y2: 22 },
      { x: 0, y: 35, y2: 30 },
      { x: 1, y: 25, y2: 22 },
      { x: 2, y: 10, y2: 12 },
      { x: 3, y: 2, y2: 5 },
      { x: 4, y: 0.5, y2: 2 }
    ]}
    xLabel="Standard Deviations from Mean"
    yLabel="Frequency"
    title="Normal Distribution vs Actual Returns (Fat Tails)"
    series={[
      { key: "y", name: "Normal", color: "#3b82f6" },
      { key: "y2", name: "Actual Returns", color: "#ef4444" }
    ]}
  />
</InteractiveExample>

<KeyTakeaway>
Financial returns are characterized by: **positive mean** (stocks go up on average), **significant variance** (daily swings are large), **negative skewness** (crashes are worse than rallies), and **high kurtosis** (extreme events happen more than normal distribution predicts).
