# Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics help us summarize and understand the characteristics of return distributions.

<WhyItMatters tldr="Your risk models assume a certain distribution. If you assume normal when reality has fat tails, you'll underestimate the probability of extreme losses by 100x or more.">
Every risk calculation, every Value-at-Risk estimate, every position sizing decision depends on understanding return distributions. Get the statistics wrong, and you'll think a -20% day is a "once in 10,000 years" event when it actually happens every few years. That miscalculation has bankrupted hedge funds and nearly collapsed the global financial system.
</WhyItMatters>

<ConceptCard title="Why Statistics Matter" type="definition">
Financial returns are random variables. **Descriptive statistics** summarize their behavior with just a few numbers: mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis. These metrics form the foundation of risk management.
</ConceptCard>

## Measures of Central Tendency

### Mean (Expected Return)

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="\bar{R} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i"
  explanation="The arithmetic mean is the simple average of all returns."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "\\bar{R}", meaning: "Mean return" },
    { symbol: "R_i", meaning: "Return in period i" },
    { symbol: "n", meaning: "Number of observations" }
  ]}
/>

<ConceptCard title="Mean vs Median" type="tip">
The **mean** is sensitive to outliers. One huge loss can drag down the average. The **median** (middle value) is more robust. Compare both to understand your data.
</ConceptCard>

## Measures of Dispersion

### Variance and Standard Deviation

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (R_i - \bar{R})^2"
  explanation="Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "\\sigma^2", meaning: "Variance" },
    { symbol: "\\sigma", meaning: "Standard deviation (square root of variance)" }
  ]}
/>

## Higher Moments

### Skewness

<ConceptCard title="Distribution Asymmetry" type="warning">
**Negative skewness** means the left tail is longer - there are more extreme losses than extreme gains. Most financial returns are negatively skewed, meaning crashes are more severe than rallies.
</ConceptCard>

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="Skew = \frac{E[(R - \mu)^3]}{\sigma^3}"
  explanation="Skewness measures asymmetry in the distribution."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "Skew > 0", meaning: "Right tail is longer (positive skew)" },
    { symbol: "Skew < 0", meaning: "Left tail is longer (negative skew)" }
  ]}
/>

### Kurtosis

<ConceptCard title="Fat Tails" type="definition">
**Kurtosis** measures how much probability is in the tails vs the center. High kurtosis ("leptokurtic") means more extreme events than a normal distribution predicts. Financial returns typically have kurtosis > 3, meaning "fat tails."
</ConceptCard>

<RealWorldExample
  title="Black Monday: A '25-Sigma Event' That Happened"
  date="October 19, 1987"
  impact="S&P 500 fell 20.4% in one day"
  sources={[
    { name: "Journal of Portfolio Management" },
    { name: "NBER - Stock Volatility and the Crash" }
  ]}
  lesson="If your model says something is impossible, the model is wrong - not reality."
>
On Black Monday, the S&P 500 fell 20.4%. Under a normal distribution with historical volatility, this was a **25-sigma event** - something that should happen once every 10^135 years (that's more than the age of the universe, raised to any power you can imagine).

**The statistics said it was impossible. It happened anyway.**

This is what fat tails (high kurtosis) means in practice. Financial returns have kurtosis of 5-10, not 3 (normal). Events that "can't happen" happen regularly:
- 1987: -20.4% (25 sigma under normal assumptions)
- 2008: Multiple -5% to -9% days
- 2020: -12% on March 16

**The lesson**: Never use normal distribution assumptions for risk management. Real returns have fatter tails.
</RealWorldExample>

<KeyTakeaway>
Financial returns are characterized by: **positive mean** (stocks go up on average), **significant variance** (daily swings are large), **negative skewness** (crashes are worse than rallies), and **high kurtosis** (extreme events happen more than normal distribution predicts).
</KeyTakeaway>

<ThinkAboutIt questions={[
  {
    question: "If financial returns aren't normally distributed, why do so many textbooks and risk models still assume normality?",
    hint: "Convenience. Normal distributions are mathematically tractable - you can derive closed-form solutions. Fat-tailed distributions are harder to work with. Many practitioners know the assumption is wrong but use it anyway, then add 'safety factors' to compensate."
  },
  {
    question: "A strategy has positive mean, low variance, positive skewness, and low kurtosis. Sounds perfect - what's the catch?",
    hint: "This profile is characteristic of 'picking up pennies in front of a steamroller' strategies - they work great until they don't. The statistics hide the tail risk that eventually destroys the strategy (see: selling volatility, selling deep out-of-money puts)."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do you think stock returns are negatively skewed (bigger crashes than rallies)?",
    hint: "Panic is faster than greed. Fear spreads quickly - everyone runs for the exit at once. Optimism builds slowly. Also, leverage forces selling into falling markets (margin calls), amplifying downside moves."
