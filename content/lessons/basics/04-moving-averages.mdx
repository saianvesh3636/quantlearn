# Moving Averages

Moving averages smooth price data to identify trends and generate trading signals. They're the foundation of many quantitative strategies.

<WhyItMatters tldr="The 200-day moving average is watched by virtually every institutional investor. When the S&P 500 breaks below it, billions of dollars move. Understanding MAs means understanding how the market actually works.">
Moving averages aren't just technical indicators - they're self-fulfilling prophecies embedded in how institutions operate. Pension funds, mutual funds, and algorithmic traders all use MAs as decision rules. When the S&P 500 crosses its 200-day MA, it triggers actual buying and selling that moves markets. You're not just analyzing price history; you're understanding the rules that govern trillions of dollars.

Raw prices are noisy - daily fluctuations obscure the underlying trend. **Moving averages** filter out noise by averaging recent prices, revealing whether the overall direction is up, down, or sideways.

## Simple Moving Average (SMA)

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="SMA_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} P_{t-i}"
  explanation="The SMA is the arithmetic mean of the last n prices."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "SMA_n", meaning: "Simple Moving Average over n periods" },
    { symbol: "P_{t-i}", meaning: "Price i periods ago" },
    { symbol: "n", meaning: "Lookback window (e.g., 20, 50, 200 days)" }
  ]}
/>

<ConceptCard title="Common MA Periods" type="tip">
- **20-day**: Short-term trend (about 1 month of trading)
- **50-day**: Medium-term trend
- **200-day**: Long-term trend (institutional benchmark)

The 200-day MA is closely watched - breaks above/below are significant events.

## Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="EMA_t = \alpha \cdot P_t + (1 - \alpha) \cdot EMA_{t-1}"
  explanation="EMA gives more weight to recent prices, responding faster to changes."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "\\alpha", meaning: "Smoothing factor = 2/(n+1)" },
    { symbol: "P_t", meaning: "Current price" },
    { symbol: "EMA_{t-1}", meaning: "Previous EMA value" }
  ]}
/>

<ConceptCard title="SMA vs EMA" type="example">
**SMA**: Equal weight to all prices in window
- Pro: Smoother, less noise
- Con: Slower to react to changes

**EMA**: More weight to recent prices
- Pro: Faster response
- Con: More false signals
</ConceptCard>

## Trading Signals

<ConceptCard title="Moving Average Crossovers" type="definition">
**Golden Cross**: Short-term MA crosses ABOVE long-term MA → Bullish signal (uptrend starting)

**Death Cross**: Short-term MA crosses BELOW long-term MA → Bearish signal (downtrend starting)

The 200-day moving average is arguably the most important line in finance:

**March 2020 COVID Crash:**
- S&P 500 broke below its 200-day MA on February 27, 2020
- This triggered systematic selling from trend-following funds
- The index fell another 25%+ over the next three weeks
- Traders who respected the signal avoided the worst of the crash

**October 2022 Bear Market:**
- S&P 500 spent 8 months below its 200-day MA
- Each failed attempt to reclaim it triggered more selling
- When it finally broke above in January 2023, it marked the start of a new bull market

**Why it matters:** Vanguard, BlackRock, and countless pension funds use MA rules for asset allocation. When the market crosses the 200-day MA, billions of dollars actually move - making the indicator partly self-fulfilling.
</RealWorldExample>

<KeyTakeaway>
Moving averages smooth price noise to reveal trends. **SMA** weights all prices equally; **EMA** emphasizes recent prices. **Crossover signals** (Golden/Death Cross) identify trend changes. The 200-day MA is the key long-term trend indicator watched by institutions.

  {
    question: "If the 200-day MA works because everyone watches it, what happens if everyone stops watching it?",
    hint: "It would lose its predictive power. Technical analysis works partly through self-fulfilling prophecy. However, as long as large institutions use it for risk management, it remains relevant. The bigger question: is there a 'better' indicator no one watches yet?"
  },
  {
    question: "Why do you think the 200-day MA (roughly 10 months of data) became the standard, rather than 150 or 250 days?",
    hint: "Partly convention, partly optimization. 200 days balances responsiveness (shorter is faster) with noise reduction (longer is smoother). But mostly it's convention - once enough people use it, switching creates coordination problems."
  },
  {
    question: "If a stock gaps down 20% overnight on earnings, the moving average barely moves. Is this a feature or a bug?",
    hint: "Feature for trend identification (you want to ignore one-day noise), bug for risk management (your stop-loss triggered, but the MA says 'still in trend'). This is why professional traders use MAs for direction but other tools for risk management."
