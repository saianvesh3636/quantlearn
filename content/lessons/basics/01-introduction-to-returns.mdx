# Introduction to Returns

Understanding returns is fundamental to quantitative finance. In this lesson, we'll explore different types of returns and how to calculate them.

<WhyItMatters tldr="Incorrect return calculations compound into massive errors over time. Getting this wrong by even 1% annually means losing half your perceived gains over 20 years.">
Returns are not just academic - they're the foundation of every trading decision you'll make. Hedge funds, pension funds, and individual traders all live and die by their return calculations. Use the wrong method, and you'll:
- **Overestimate your strategy's performance** (leading to excessive risk-taking)
- **Make incorrect position sizing decisions** (losing money you shouldn't)
- **Fail to properly compare strategies** (choosing inferior approaches)
</WhyItMatters>

<ConceptCard title="What is a Return?" type="definition">
A **return** measures the percentage change in the value of an investment over a period of time. Returns allow us to compare investments of different sizes on an equal footing.
</ConceptCard>

## Types of Returns

There are two main ways to calculate returns: **Simple Returns** and **Log Returns**. Each has its own advantages.

### Simple Returns

Simple (or arithmetic) returns represent the straightforward percentage change:

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="R_t = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} = \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1"
  explanation="This formula calculates the percentage gain or loss from one period to the next."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "R_t", meaning: "Return at time t" },
    { symbol: "P_t", meaning: "Price at time t" },
    { symbol: "P_{t-1}", meaning: "Price at previous time period" }
  ]}
/>

<ConceptCard title="Example: Calculating Simple Returns" type="example">
If a stock price moves from $100 to $110:

**Simple Return** = ($110 - $100) / $100 = **10%**

If it then moves from $110 to $99:

**Simple Return** = ($99 - $110) / $110 = **-10%**
</ConceptCard>

### Log Returns

Logarithmic (or continuously compounded) returns use natural logarithms:

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="r_t = \ln\left(\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}\right) = \ln(P_t) - \ln(P_{t-1})"
  explanation="Log returns have special mathematical properties that make them useful for statistical analysis."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "r_t", meaning: "Log return at time t" },
    { symbol: "\\ln", meaning: "Natural logarithm" },
    { symbol: "P_t", meaning: "Price at time t" }
  ]}
/>

## Why Use Log Returns?

<ConceptCard title="Advantages of Log Returns" type="tip">
1. **Additivity**: Log returns can be summed over time periods
2. **Symmetry**: A +10% gain and -10% loss are symmetric
3. **Statistical Properties**: Better suited for statistical modeling (approximately normal distribution)

<RealWorldExample
  title="Renaissance Technologies' Medallion Fund"
  date="1988-2018"
  impact="$100 → $398.7 million"
  sources={[
    { name: "Cornell Capital Group", url: "https://www.cornell-capital.com/blog/2020/02/medallion-fund-the-ultimate-counterexample.html" },
    { name: "Visual Capitalist" }
  ]}
  lesson="Understanding compounding (and using log returns correctly) is essential for evaluating long-term performance."
>
The Medallion Fund achieved **66% average annual returns before fees** over 30 years. But here's where return math matters:

- **Simple arithmetic average**: 66% per year sounds like 66% × 30 = 1,980% total
- **Actual compounded result**: $100 became $398.7 million (398,700,000% return)

The difference is staggering because **returns compound**. Log returns correctly capture this compounding effect, which is why quant professionals use them for multi-period analysis. If you averaged their returns incorrectly, you'd massively underestimate their actual performance.
</RealWorldExample>

<KeyTakeaway>
For small returns (under 10%), simple and log returns are nearly identical. For larger returns or longer time periods, the difference becomes significant. Quant professionals typically use **log returns** for statistical analysis.
