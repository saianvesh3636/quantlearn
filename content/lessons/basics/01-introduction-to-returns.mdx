# Introduction to Returns

Understanding returns is fundamental to quantitative finance. In this lesson, we'll explore different types of returns and how to calculate them.

<ConceptCard title="What is a Return?" type="definition">
A **return** measures the percentage change in the value of an investment over a period of time. Returns allow us to compare investments of different sizes on an equal footing.
</ConceptCard>

## Types of Returns

There are two main ways to calculate returns: **Simple Returns** and **Log Returns**. Each has its own advantages.

### Simple Returns

Simple (or arithmetic) returns represent the straightforward percentage change:

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="R_t = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} = \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1"
  explanation="This formula calculates the percentage gain or loss from one period to the next."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "R_t", meaning: "Return at time t" },
    { symbol: "P_t", meaning: "Price at time t" },
    { symbol: "P_{t-1}", meaning: "Price at previous time period" }
  ]}
/>

<ConceptCard title="Example: Calculating Simple Returns" type="example">
If a stock price moves from $100 to $110:

**Simple Return** = ($110 - $100) / $100 = **10%**

If it then moves from $110 to $99:

**Simple Return** = ($99 - $110) / $110 = **-10%**
</ConceptCard>

### Log Returns

Logarithmic (or continuously compounded) returns use natural logarithms:

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="r_t = \ln\left(\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}\right) = \ln(P_t) - \ln(P_{t-1})"
  explanation="Log returns have special mathematical properties that make them useful for statistical analysis."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "r_t", meaning: "Log return at time t" },
    { symbol: "\\ln", meaning: "Natural logarithm" },
    { symbol: "P_t", meaning: "Price at time t" }
  ]}
/>

## Why Use Log Returns?

<ConceptCard title="Advantages of Log Returns" type="tip">
1. **Additivity**: Log returns can be summed over time periods
2. **Symmetry**: A +10% gain and -10% loss are symmetric
3. **Statistical Properties**: Better suited for statistical modeling (approximately normal distribution)

<KeyTakeaway>
For small returns (under 10%), simple and log returns are nearly identical. For larger returns or longer time periods, the difference becomes significant. Quant professionals typically use **log returns** for statistical analysis.
