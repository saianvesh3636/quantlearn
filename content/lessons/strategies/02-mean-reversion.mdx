# Mean Reversion

Mean reversion is the opposite of trend following. The core idea: prices that deviate from their average tend to return to it.

<ConceptCard title="Mean Reversion Philosophy" type="definition">
**"What goes up must come down."** Mean reversion traders bet that extreme moves will reverse. They buy dips and sell rallies, profiting from prices returning to "normal" levels.
</ConceptCard>

## Z-Score Trading

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="Z = \frac{Price - MA}{\sigma}"
  explanation="Z-score measures how many standard deviations price is from its mean."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "Z", meaning: "Z-score (standardized deviation)" },
    { symbol: "Price", meaning: "Current price" },
    { symbol: "MA", meaning: "Moving average (mean)" },
    { symbol: "\\sigma", meaning: "Standard deviation" }
  ]}
/>

<ConceptCard title="Z-Score Signals" type="example">
- **Z > 2**: Price is 2 std devs above mean → Sell (overbought)
- **Z < -2**: Price is 2 std devs below mean → Buy (oversold)
- **Z → 0**: Price returning to mean → Exit position
</ConceptCard>

## Pairs Trading

<ConceptCard title="Statistical Arbitrage" type="definition">
**Pairs trading** finds two correlated assets and trades their spread. When the spread widens beyond normal, bet on convergence. This is market-neutral (no exposure to overall market direction).
</ConceptCard>

      { x: 3, y: 1.5, y2: 2, y3: -2 },

## Risks of Mean Reversion

<ConceptCard title="The Danger" type="warning">
Mean reversion fails when:
- **Regime change**: The "mean" shifts permanently
- **Trending markets**: What looks oversold keeps falling
- **Leverage**: Small adverse moves can wipe out capital

Famous blow-ups (LTCM, 2008 quant crisis) often involved mean reversion strategies that faced unprecedented moves.
</ConceptCard>

<KeyTakeaway>
Mean reversion profits from prices returning to average. It has **high win rates** but **occasional large losses** when means shift. Use z-scores to identify extremes, pairs trading for market neutrality, and always have stop losses for when "cheap" gets cheaper.
</KeyTakeaway>
