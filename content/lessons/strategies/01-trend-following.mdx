# Trend Following

Trend following is one of the oldest and most robust trading strategies. The core idea: prices that are going up tend to keep going up.

<ConceptCard title="The Trend Following Philosophy" type="definition">
**"The trend is your friend."** Trend followers don't predict where prices will go - they react to what prices are doing. When a trend starts, they get on board. When it ends, they get off.

## Moving Average Crossovers

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="Signal = \begin{cases} Buy & \text{if } SMA_{fast} > SMA_{slow} \\ Sell & \text{if } SMA_{fast} < SMA_{slow} \end{cases}"
  explanation="The classic dual moving average crossover system."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "SMA_{fast}", meaning: "Short-term moving average (e.g., 20-day)" },
    { symbol: "SMA_{slow}", meaning: "Long-term moving average (e.g., 50-day)" }
  ]}

## Breakout Systems

<ConceptCard title="Channel Breakout" type="example">
**Donchian Channel**: Buy when price breaks above the 20-day high, sell when it breaks below the 20-day low. This was the system used by the famous Turtle Traders.
</ConceptCard>

<FormulaDisplay
  formula="Upper = \max(High_{t-n}, ..., High_{t-1})"
  explanation="The upper channel is the highest high over the lookback period."
  variables={[
    { symbol: "Upper", meaning: "Upper breakout level" },
    { symbol: "n", meaning: "Lookback period (e.g., 20 days)" }
  ]}
/>

## Why Trends Exist

<ConceptCard title="Behavioral Basis" type="tip">
Trends persist because of:
- **Anchoring**: Investors slow to update beliefs
- **Herding**: People follow others
- **Confirmation bias**: We seek info that confirms our positions
- **Slow information diffusion**: News takes time to fully reflect in prices

    title="Trend Following: Big Wins, Many Small Losses"
  />
</InteractiveExample>

<ConceptCard title="The Trend Following Profile" type="warning">
Trend following has a **low win rate** (often 30-40%) but **large winners**. You'll have many small losses waiting for trends, then occasional big wins when trends develop. Psychologically difficult but mathematically sound.
</ConceptCard>

<KeyTakeaway>
Trend following works because markets trend due to behavioral biases. The strategy has low win rates but high reward-to-risk. Use moving averages or breakouts to identify trends, and always use stop losses to limit the many small losses.
</KeyTakeaway>
